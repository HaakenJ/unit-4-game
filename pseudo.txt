TODO AND BUGS:

- when the user loses, the game needs to end.  Currently the enemy stays on the screen and the attack button still works.

- refreshing the page after both the enemy and the user have been defeated doesn't restart the game.


















Game starts with four characters displayed at the top of the page.
Their health is displayed below a picture of the characters
    each character has characteristics:
        - base Attack
        - Health Points
        - Current Attack Power
        - Counter Attack Power
'Your character' is displayed below the choices
'Enemies Available To Attack' is below a blank space where the enemies will go.
'Fight section' 
'Attack' button
'Defender'

when a user clicks a character, that character moves under the 'Your character' heading

The other characters turn red and move under 'Enemies Available to Attack'

Clicking an enemy moves them below the 'Defender' heading and turns the card black

When the user clicks the attack button:
    - If no enemy has been selected, display 'No enemy is here.'
    - Info is displayed below the enemy:
        - 'You attacked Darth Maul for ${obiWan.currentAttackPower} damage.' - The attack notification.
        - 'Darth Maul attacked you back for ${darthMaul.counterAttackPower} damage' - The coutner attack notification.
    - Your character's health is decreased by enemy.counterAttackPower amount.
    - The enemy's health is decreased by yourCharacter.currentAttackPower amount.

When the user clicks the attack button again:
    - yourCharacter.currentAttackPower is increased by yourCharacter.baseAttackPower

If the user's character's health reaches 0:
    - Display 'You have been defeated....GAME OVER' below the enemy character.
    - display a restart button which resets:
        - The whole game, characters to top of screen, all variables back to base values.

If the enemy's health reaches 0:
    - clear the enemy's card from the screen.
    - display 'You have defeated ${enemyCharacter.name}, you can choose to fight another enemy'.

The user chooses another enemy.
    - yourCharacter.currentAttackPower is maintained from the previous battle.




-----Ideas------

- Could have levels
    - After you beat the first round of characters, your health resets and new enemies pop up. 
        - Such as Darth Vader and the Emporor
